### Exploratory data analysis:
#### Principal component analysis and PAM algorithm in application

This is a project exploring the dataset of 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑚 collected and complied by Joseph Nathan Cohen and Joseph van der Naald. Observations cover 46 countries in the world from 2015 to 2017. It measures various approaches by which governments intervene in the market including the government’s expenditures, investment, tax revenue, and economic regulations. There is also an indicator measuring the societal conformity to democratic ideals.

Two EDA methods will be applied in the project:
- Principal component analysis: a technique from dimension reduction underlying the principles of eigenvalue to truncate a number of correlated variables into a smaller number of linearly combined variables called principal component.
- PAM(partition around medoids) clustering: a technique that can be used to divide data into different groups, where each group is similar to one another in certain ways.

This exploratory project is trying to use these classic tools, interpret their results, and, hopefully, it can explore the essence of data and the relationship between democracy and the free-market system.
